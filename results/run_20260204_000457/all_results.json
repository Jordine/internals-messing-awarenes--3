Therefore, Alice is indeed taller than Carol.

It's a simple yet effective way to assess one's ability to think critically and make deductions based on given information. \n\nThe key to solving this problem lies in recognizing the transitive nature of the \"taller than\" relationship.

If `n` is divisible by any number in this range, it is not prime and the function returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`. The function also handles edge cases where `n` is less than or equal to 1, which are not considered prime numbers. \n\nNote: This implementation uses the fact that a larger factor of the number would be a multiple of smaller factor that has already been checked. Therefore, we only need to check up to the square root of `n`. This reduces the time complexity of the algorithm from O(n) to O(sqrt(n)).",
